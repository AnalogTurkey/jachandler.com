      <description>Previously the site was hosted across a number of providers to maximize the respective benefits of each of their free tiers. Now, however, Netlify combines many of their best aspects into one service. The site&amp;rsquo;s CDN is handled by Cloudflare. Free CDN, DNS, optimizations, and added security.
Images are hosted using Backblaze B2. Although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support many of the features of other cloud storage solutions, it&amp;rsquo;s a good bit cheaper.</description>

      <title>Amazon S3 Request Security</title>

      <description>AWS&#39;s request rules and lack of useful customizable limits allow attackers to rack up high bills for S3 bucket owners, including on fully private buckets. The only effective defense is to immediately delete the affected resources when they are targeted. The Problem One of my goals with this site was to create the most functional website possible at the lowest possible cost. And sure, setting up a static site hosting bucket on S3 and forgetting about it seems like a simple solution.</description>

      <title>Building the Site</title>

      <description>This website was made using Hugo. It is deployed and built on Netlify with images handled by Netlify large media.
The layout is based on the DocDock theme. This includes Featherlight for lightbox viewing. Responsive images and lazyloading use Lazysizes. This is implemented through a Hugo shortcode which selects from 8 variants of each image, one full-sized and only loaded when the image is clicked.
I would have liked to use Commento for the comment system; it&amp;rsquo;s lightweight, respects privacy, and has good social integration given its size.</description>
