      <description>Previously the site was hosted across a number of providers to maximize the respective benefits of each of their free tiers. Now, however, Netlify combines many of their best aspects into one service. The site&amp;rsquo;s CDN is handled by Cloudflare. Free CDN, DNS, optimizations, and added security.
Images are hosted using Backblaze B2. Although it doesn&amp;rsquo;t support many of the features of other cloud storage solutions, it&amp;rsquo;s a good bit cheaper.</description>

      <description>Full Writeup Coming Soon! A preamplifier and power board I made for a stereo electret measurement microphone rig. This PCB is optimized for the Primo EM258 or Panasonic WM61 but may be used with others with some resistor value adjustments.
Fresh bare PCB&amp;rsquo;s, expo marker for scale.
A fully assembled board.
The hand-soldered LDO, with tweezers and solder wire for scale.
The back of the board.</description>

      <description>Work in Progress! The &amp;lsquo;Testing Of Headphone Responses Unit&amp;rsquo; (TOHRU) is a stereo electret microphone rig used for acoustic measurements. Still a work in progress. Currently has a flat closed-cell foam coupler for headphone measurements.
A temporary taped-together version of the rig for testing before final assembly.
A 1kHz FFT of the Sennheiser HD650 measured by TOHRU. Distortion is below -60dB (0.1%).
An uncompensated frequency response comparison between the Monoprice Retro and Sennheiser HD650.</description>

      <title>Sony MDR-1000X Repair</title>

      <description>A Fallen Titan When the Sony MDR-1000X came out in 2016, much of the audiophile community fell head over heels for it; Bose finally had a competitor in the high-performance ANC headphone space. After a few months, however, opinions of Sony were markedly less rosy: a poorly designed headband was causing premature failure in many of the units, and even worse, Sony was refusing to cover the failures under warranty1.</description>

      <title>Amazon S3 Request Security</title>

      <description>AWS&#39;s request rules and lack of useful customizable limits allow attackers to rack up high bills for S3 bucket owners, including on fully private buckets. The only effective defense is to immediately delete the affected resources when they are targeted. The Problem One of my goals with this site was to create the most functional website possible at the lowest possible cost. And sure, setting up a static site hosting bucket on S3 and forgetting about it seems like a simple solution.</description>

      <title>Building the Site</title>

      <description>This website was made using Hugo. It is deployed and built on Netlify with images handled by Netlify large media.
The layout is based on the DocDock theme. This includes Featherlight for lightbox viewing. Responsive images and lazyloading use Lazysizes. This is implemented through a Hugo shortcode which selects from 8 variants of each image, one full-sized and only loaded when the image is clicked.
I would have liked to use Commento for the comment system; it&amp;rsquo;s lightweight, respects privacy, and has good social integration given its size.</description>

      <title>Das Model S Mac Restoration</title>

      <description>I found a Das Model S keyboard in bad shape at the campus surplus store and decided to fix it up (and take a look inside). For the past few weeks, I’ve been visiting the surplus store on campus regularly. Normally they have some interesting vintage boards in stock: so far I’ve seen buckling spring, “space invaders”, and a wide variety of Alps and Alps clones. The only Cherry board I’ve encountered so far has been a Das Model S Mac keyboard, which I bought for $2.</description>
